# Mounting EFS file systems<a name="mounting-fs"></a>

In the following section, you can learn how to mount your Amazon EFS file system on a Linux instance using the Amazon EFS mount helper\. In addition, you can find how to use the fileÂ `fstab` to automatically remount your file system after any system restarts\. To learn more about the Amazon EFS mount helper, see [EFS Mount Helper](efs-mount-helper.md)\.

**Note**  
Amazon EFS does not support mounting from Amazon EC2 Windows instances\.
Amazon EFS does not support mounting from Amazon EC2 Mac instances\.

Before the Amazon EFS mount helper was available, we recommended mounting your Amazon EFS file systems using the standard Linux NFS client\. For more information on those changes, see [Mounting File Systems Without the EFS Mount Helper](mounting-fs-old.md)\.

**Note**  
You can configure a new Amazon EC2 Linux instance to mount an Amazon EFS file system when it launches\. However, before you mount a file system, you must create, configure, and launch your related AWS resources\. For detailed instructions, see [Getting Started with Amazon Elastic File System](getting-started.md)\.

## Installing the amazon\-efs\-utils package<a name="mounting-fs-install-amazon-efs-utils"></a>

To mount your Amazon EFS file system on your Amazon EC2 instance, we recommend that you use the mount helper in the amazon\-efs\-utils package\. The amazon\-efs\-utils package is an open\-source collection of Amazon EFS tools\.
