# Creating Mount Targets in Another VPC<a name="manage-fs-access-change-vpc"></a>

You can use an Amazon EFS file system in one VPC at a time\. That is, you create mount targets in a VPC for your file system, and use those mount targets to provide access to the file system from EC2 instances in that VPC\. To access the file system from EC2 instances in another VPC, you must first delete the mount targets from the current VPC and then create new mount targets in another VPC\.

## Working with VPC Peering in Amazon EFS<a name="manage-fs-access-vpc-peering"></a>

A *VPC peering connection *is a networking connection between two VPCs that enables you to route traffic between them using private Internet Protocol version 4 \(IPv4\) or Internet Protocol version 6 \(IPv6\) addresses\. For more information on VPC peering, see [What is VPC Peering?](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/peering/Welcome.html) in the *Amazon VPC Peering Guide\.*

You can mount Amazon EFS file systems over VPC connections by using VPC peering within a single AWS Region when using the Amazon EC2 instance types T3, C5, C5d, I3\.metal, M5, M5d, R5, R5d, and z1d\. However, other VPC private connectivity mechanisms such as inter\-region VPC peering and VPC peering within an AWS Region using other instance types are not supported\.

Domain Name System \(DNS\) name resolution for EFS mount points in peered VPCs is not supported\. Use the IP address of the mount points in the corresponding Availability Zone to mount EFS file systems\. Alternatively, you can use Amazon RouteÂ 53 as your DNS service, and create a [Private Hosted Zone](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/hosted-zones-private.html) and [Resource Record Set](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/rrsets-working-with.html) to resolve the EFS mount target IP addresses from another VPC\.

## Using the Console<a name="manage-fs-access-change-vpc-using-console"></a>

1. In the Amazon EFS console, select the file system, choose **Actions**, and then choose **Manage File System Access**\. 

   The console displays the **Manage File System Access** page with a list of mount targets you created for the file system in a VPC\. The following illustration shows a file system that has three mount targets, one in each Availability Zones\.

1. To change the VPC, select another VPC from the **VPC** list\.

   The console clears all of the mount target information and lists only the Availability Zone\. 

1. Create mount targets in one or more Availability Zones as follows:

   1. If the Availability Zone has multiple subnets, select a subnet from the **Subnet** list\.

   1. Amazon EFS automatically selects an available IP address, or you can provide another IP address explicitly\.

   1. Choose the security groups that you want to associate\. 

      For information about security groups, see [Amazon EC2 Security Groups](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-network-security.html) in the *Amazon EC2 User Guide for Linux Instances*\.

1. Choose **Save**\.

   The console first deletes the mount targets from the previous VPC and then creates new mount targets in the new VPC that you selected\. 

## Using the CLI<a name="manage-fs-access-change-vpc-using-cli"></a>

To use a file system in another VPC, you must first delete any mount targets you previously created in a VPC and then create new mount targets in another VPC\. For example AWS CLI commands, see [Creating or Deleting Mount Targets in a VPC](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/efs/latest/ug/manage-fs-access-create-delete-mount-targets.html#manage-fs-create-delete-mt-cli)\.
