# LifecyclePolicy<a name="API_LifecyclePolicy"></a>

Describes a policy used by EFS lifecycle management and EFS Intelligent\-Tiering that specifies when to transition files into and out of the file system's Infrequent Access \(IA\) storage class\. For more information, see [EFS Intelligent‚ÄêTiering and EFS Lifecycle Management](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/efs/latest/ug/lifecycle-management-efs.html)\.

**Note**  
When using the `put-lifecycle-configuration` CLI command or the `PutLifecycleConfiguration` API action, Amazon EFS requires that each `LifecyclePolicy` object have only a single transition\. This means that in a request body, `LifecyclePolicies` must be structured as an array of `LifecyclePolicy` objects, one object for each transition, `TransitionToIA`, `TransitionToPrimaryStorageClass`\. For more information, see the request examples in [PutLifecycleConfiguration](API_PutLifecycleConfiguration.md)\.
