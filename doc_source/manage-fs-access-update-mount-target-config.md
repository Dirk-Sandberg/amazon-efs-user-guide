# Updating the Mount Target Configuration<a name="manage-fs-access-update-mount-target-config"></a>

After you create a mount target for your file system, you may want to update security groups that are in effect\. You cannot change the IP address of an existing mount target\. To change IP address you must delete the mount target and create a new one with the new address\. Deleting a mount target breaks any existing file system mounts\. 

## Modifying the Security Group<a name="manage-fs-access-update-mount-target-config-sg"></a>

Security groups define inbound/outbound access\. When you change security groups associated with a mount target, make sure that you authorize necessary inbound/outbound access so that your EC2 instance can communicate with the file system\. 

For more information about security groups, see [Amazon EC2 Security Groups](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-network-security.html) in the *Amazon EC2 User Guide for Linux Instances*\.

### Using the Console<a name="manage-fs-access-update-mount-target-config-sg-console"></a>

1. In the Amazon EFS console, select the file system, choose **Actions**, and then choose **Manage File System Access**\. 

   The console displays the **Manage File System Access** page with a list of Availability Zones and mount target information, if there is a mount target in the Availability Zone\.

1. In the **Security Group** column, you can add or remove security groups\. Choose **X** to remove an existing security group\. Choose the **Security Group** box to select from other available security groups\.

   If you remove all security groups, Amazon EFS assigns the VPC's default security group\. 

### Using the CLI<a name="manage-fs-access-update-mount-target-config-sg-cli"></a>

To modify security groups that are in effect for a mount target, use the `modify-mount-target-security-group` AWS CLI command \(corresponding operation is [ModifyMountTargetSecurityGroups](API_ModifyMountTargetSecurityGroups.md)\) to replace any existing security groups, as shown following:

```
$ aws efs modify-mount-target-security-groups \
--mount-target-id mount-target-ID-whose-configuration-to-update \
--security-groups  security-group-ids-separated-by-space \
--region aws-region-where-mount-target-exists \
--profile adminuser
```
