## Contents<a name="API_FileSystemDescription_Contents"></a>

 **CreationTime**   <a name="efs-Type-FileSystemDescription-CreationTime"></a>
Time that the file system was created, in seconds \(since 1970\-01\-01T00:00:00Z\)\.  
Type: Timestamp  
Required: Yes

 **CreationToken**   <a name="efs-Type-FileSystemDescription-CreationToken"></a>
Opaque string specified in the request\.  
Type: String  
Length Constraints: Minimum length of 1\. Maximum length of 64\.

Type: String  
Required: Yes

 **KmsKeyId**   <a name="efs-Type-FileSystemDescription-KmsKeyId"></a>
The ID of an AWS Key Management Service \(AWS KMS\) customer master key \(CMK\) that was used to protect the encrypted file system\.  
Type: String  
Length Constraints: Minimum length of 1\. Maximum length of 2048\.  
Required: No

 **LifeCycleState**   <a name="efs-Type-FileSystemDescription-LifeCycleState"></a>
Lifecycle phase of the file system\.  
Type: String  
Valid Values:` creating | available | updating | deleting | deleted`   
Required: Yes

 **Name**   <a name="efs-Type-FileSystemDescription-Name"></a>
You can add tags to a file system, including a `Name` tag\. For more information, see [CreateTags](API_CreateTags.md)\. If the file system has a `Name` tag, Amazon EFS returns the value in this field\.   
Type: String  
Length Constraints: Maximum length of 256\.  
Required: No

 **NumberOfMountTargets**   <a name="efs-Type-FileSystemDescription-NumberOfMountTargets"></a>
Current number of mount targets that the file system has\. For more information, see [CreateMountTarget](API_CreateMountTarget.md)\.  
Type: Integer  
Valid Range: Minimum value of 0\.  
Required: Yes

 **OwnerId**   <a name="efs-Type-FileSystemDescription-OwnerId"></a>
AWS account that created the file system\. If the file system was created by an IAM user, the parent account to which the user belongs is the owner\.  
Type: String  
Required: Yes

 **PerformanceMode**   <a name="efs-Type-FileSystemDescription-PerformanceMode"></a>
The `PerformanceMode` of the file system\.  
Type: String  
Valid Values:` generalPurpose | maxIO`   
Required: Yes

 **ProvisionedThroughputInMibps**   <a name="efs-Type-FileSystemDescription-ProvisionedThroughputInMibps"></a>
The throughput, measured in MiB/s, that you want to provision for a file system\. The limit on throughput is 1024 MiB/s\. You can get these limits increased by contacting AWS Support\. For more information, see [Amazon EFS Limits That You Can Increase](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/efs/latest/ug/limits.html#soft-limits) in the *Amazon EFS User Guide\.*   
Type: Double  
Valid Range: Minimum value of 0\.0\.  
Required: No

 **SizeInBytes**   <a name="efs-Type-FileSystemDescription-SizeInBytes"></a>
Latest known metered size \(in bytes\) of data stored in the file system, in its `Value` field, and the time at which that size was determined in its `Timestamp` field\. The `Timestamp` value is the integer number of seconds since 1970\-01\-01T00:00:00Z\. The `SizeInBytes` value doesn't represent the size of a consistent snapshot of the file system, but it is eventually consistent when there are no writes to the file system\. That is, `SizeInBytes` represents actual size only if the file system is not modified for a period longer than a couple of hours\. Otherwise, the value is not the exact size that the file system was at any point in time\.   
Type: [FileSystemSize](API_FileSystemSize.md) object  
Required: Yes

 **ThroughputMode**   <a name="efs-Type-FileSystemDescription-ThroughputMode"></a>
The throughput mode for a file system\. There are two throughput modes to choose from for your file system: bursting and provisioned\. You can decrease your file system's throughput in Provisioned Throughput mode or change between the throughput modes as long as itâ€™s been more than 24 hours since the last decrease or throughput mode change\.  
Type: String  
Valid Values:` bursting | provisioned`   
Required: No
